    <h1>About Us....</h1>
    <p>
        <br></br>
    Our website, Pet Heaven, is a charity society that cares for the welfare of abandoned pets (i.e. cats and dogs where the original owner no longer want to keep them), and allow online visitors to make request for adoption of the abandoned pets. We will follow up with the online request, interview the requester, and find a suitable home for the abandoned pet.    <center><hr width="20%" size="5px" color="white"></hr></center>

    <h1>Only adoption service?</h1>
    <br></br>
    <p>
    NO!!! We also accept the pets that the owners wanted to release to our society for any reason. The visitors can be a supporter of our society by registering directly online as well.
